# Private Blockchain Application

You are starting your journey as a Blockchain Developer, this project allows you to demonstrate
that you are familiarized with the fundamentals concepts of a Blockchain platform.
Concepts like:
    - Block
    - Blockchain
    - Wallet
    - Blockchain Identity
    - Proof of Existance

Are some of the most important components in the Blockchain Framework that you will need to describe and also
why not? Implement too.

In this project you will have a boilerplate code with a REST Api already setup to expose some of the functionalities
you will implement in your private blockchain.

## What problem will you solve implementing this private Blockchain application?

Your employer is trying to make a test of concept on how a Blockchain application can be implemented in his company.
He is an astronomy fans and he spend most of his free time on searching stars in the sky, that's why he would like
to create a test application that will allows him to register stars, and also some others of his friends can register stars
too but making sure the application know who owned each star.

## What tools or technologies you will use to create this application?

- This application will be created using Node.js and Javascript programming language. The architecture will use ES6 classes
because it will help us to organize the code and facilitate the maintnance of the code.
- The company suggest to use Visual Studio Code as an IDE to write your code because it will help you debug the code easily
but you can choose the code editor you feel confortable with.
- Some of the libraries or npm modules you will use are:
    - "bitcoinjs-lib": "^4.0.3",
    - "bitcoinjs-message": "^2.0.0",
    - "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
    - "crypto-js": "^3.1.9-1",
    - "express": "^4.16.4",
    - "hex2ascii": "0.0.3",
    - "morgan": "^1.9.1"
    Remember if you need install any other library you will use `npm install <npm_module_name>`

Libraries purpose:

1. `bitcoinjs-lib` and `bitcoinjs-message`. Those libraries will help us to verify the wallet address ownership, we are going to use it to verify the signature.
2. `express` The REST Api created for the purpose of this project it is being created using Express.js framework.
3. `body-parser` this library will be used as middleware module for Express and will help us to read the json data submitted in a POST request.
4. `crypto-js` This module contain some of the most important cryotographic methods and will help us to create the block hash.
5. `hex2ascii` This library will help us to **decode** the data saved in the body of a Block.
